- **How I scraped the data**: I used the GitHub API to scrape users located in Austin with over 100 followers and collected data about their public repositories.
- **Interesting fact**: I found that most users in Austin prefer JavaScript, and there is a surprisingly high number of open-source repositories.
- **Recommendation**: Developers should focus on contributing to open-source projects in popular languages like JavaScript to increase their visibility.
